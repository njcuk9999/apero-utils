- multi_object_validations.py
    
        Plots the RV rms vs median RV uncertainty and BERV coverage for all HA and HE lbl_target_template.rdb files. 
        The output is two figures (HA_multi-object_validation.pdf and HE_multi-object_validation.pdf)
        for which the top row shows all the points and the bottom row has the > 1 sigma outliers removed.
