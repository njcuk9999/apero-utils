# what type of activity correction do we want?
# type and option
# type: 'RV' and 'QuasiPer' -> a GP on the RV itself with a quasi-periodic kernel
#                              -> this could be modfied to include another kernel
#       'Detrend' and 'DTEMP' -> a linear detrending of the RVs with a temperature proxy
#       'Detrend' and 'd2v' -> a linear detrending of the RVs with a second derivative proxy
#       'Detrend' and 'DTEMP_deriv' -> a linear detrending of the RVs with a temperature change proxy
#       'Detrend' and 'd2v_deriv' -> a linear detrending of the RVs with a second derivative temperature change
#       'train' and 'DTEMP' -> train GP on the DTEMP and apply to RV GP as a kernel
#       'train' and 'd2v' -> train GP on the d2v and apply to RV GP as a kernel
#       'BERV' and 'SqExp' -> a GP on the BERV without a periodic term (only square expo)
#       'None' and 'None' -> no activity correction, only keplerian fit
